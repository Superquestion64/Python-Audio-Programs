# Become a Server and Establish Voice Calls
For Call_Client.py to work a server computer has to be running this program. This will enable clients to join voice calls with each other
- The server will exchange audio from one client's default input device to the other client's default output device, which effectively creates a voice call
- Multiple pairs of clients are able to connect to the server and form voice calls
- Call_Server.py is run by simply using: <br> <br>
**python Call_Server.py** <br>

**Note:** All firewalls should also be disabled
